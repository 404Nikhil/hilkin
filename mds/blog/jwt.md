## What is JWT?

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are an open, industry-standard method for securely representing claims between two parties. A JWT is a compact, URL-safe token that consists of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. Each part is encoded and concatenated with dots.

### Structure of a JWT

1. **Header**: Contains metadata about the type of token and the hashing algorithm used, typically HMAC SHA256 or RSA.
2. **Payload**: Contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. There are three types of claims: registered, public, and private claims.
3. **Signature**: Verifies that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is and ensures that the message wasn't changed along the way.

### Authentication vs. Authorization

- **Authentication**: The process of verifying who a user is. JWTs are commonly used for authentication by including a signature that verifies the token's integrity and authenticity.
- **Authorization**: The process of verifying what specific applications, files, and data a user has access to. After a user is authenticated, a JWT can be used to check their authorization level and access permissions.

## JWT is Stateless

Unlike traditional session-based authentication, JWTs are stateless. This means the server does not need to store session data. Instead, the client stores the token, and the server decodes and verifies it with each request.

## Secure Storage of JWTs on the Client Side

To securely store a JWT on the client side, you can use:

- **Local Storage**: Simple but prone to XSS attacks.
- **Session Storage**: Similar to local storage but is cleared when the page session ends.
- **Cookies**: Using HTTP-only cookies can mitigate some security risks.

It is best to set an expiry time for tokens and implement a mechanism for refreshing them using refresh tokens.

## Common Use Cases

JWTs are commonly used in scenarios such as:

- Single Sign-On (SSO)
- Mobile applications
- API authentication
- Cross-domain authentication

## How to Invalidate a JWT?

JWTs themselves cannot be invalidated. However, you can use a refresh token mechanism to handle this. When a token expires, the client can use a refresh token to request a new JWT.

## JWT vs. Sessions

In a traditional three-tier architecture (client-server-database), session-based authentication requires reading and writing to the database, which can slow down the system. To mitigate this, a stateless mechanism like JWT can be used, where database access is not required for each request.

### Sessions

- Validate credentials by querying the database.
- Requires server-side storage of session data.
- Slower due to I/O operations with the database.

### JWT

- Encodes user credentials and claims in the token itself.
- No server-side storage required.
- Faster as it minimizes I/O operations.

## Refresh Token Endpoint

To maintain seamless user experience and security, you can implement a refresh token endpoint.

### Example: Refresh Access Token API

POST /users/refresh-token

The Refresh Access Token API allows clients to request a new access token using a refresh token. The refresh token typically has a longer expiry time compared to the access token. When the client makes a request to this endpoint, a new access token is issued, and the expired one is replaced.

This functionality ensures continuous access to protected resources without requiring the user to reauthenticate manually. By utilizing the refresh token, the API securely refreshes the access token and updates it in a cookie, ensuring seamless and uninterrupted access to authorized endpoints.

By understanding and implementing JWTs effectively, you can build more secure and efficient authentication systems for your applications.

# **Welcome to the World of Tailcall**
*Where cloud-native architecture meets innovative GraphQL solutions, promising to revolutionize API management.*

In this comprehensive guide, we will embark on a journey to set up Tailcall using the official repository on GitHub. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a fully functional Tailcall instance, ready to harness the high-performance capabilities of API orchestration.

## **What is GraphQL, and Why is it Needed?**

Before delving into Tailcall, let's understand the foundation it builds uponâ€”GraphQL. GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries using a type system you define for your data. GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data.

A GraphQL service is created by defining types and fields on those types, then providing functions for each field on each type. For example, a GraphQL service that tells you who the logged-in user is (me) as well as that user's name might look like this:

```graphql
type Query {
  me: User
}
type User {  
  id: ID  
  name: String
}
```

Along with functions for each field on each type:

```javascript
function Query_me(request) {
  return request.auth.user
}

function User_name(user) {
  return user.getName()
}
```

After a GraphQL service is running (typically at a URL on a web service), it can receive GraphQL queries to validate and execute. The service first checks a query to ensure it only refers to the types and fields defined, and then runs the provided functions to produce a result.

For example, the query:

```graphql
{
  me {
    name
  }
}
```

Could produce the following JSON result:

```json
{
  "me": {
    "name": "John Doe"
  }
}
```

## **Introduction: Unveiling GraphQL Frameworks**

This repo orchestrates a thorough analysis of prominent GraphQL frameworks, providing a detailed exploration of their performance metrics.

## **Benchmark Results: Tailcall Leading the Charge**

Witness the benchmark results, a testament to Tailcall's supremacy in the realm of GraphQL frameworks:

| Server          | Requests/sec | Latency (ms) |
|-----------------|--------------|--------------|
| Tailcall        | 7,882.65     | 12.68        |
| Caliban         | 7,020.21     | 14.44        |
| Gqlgen          | 2,059.43     | 50.10        |
| Apollo GraphQL  | 1,883.97     | 52.89        |
| Netflix DGS     | 1,364.72     | 77.37        |

### **Throughput (Higher is Better):**

## **Why Tailcall Excels: Unveiling the Architecture**

Explore the architecture behind the benchmarks, where a client (wrk) sends requests to a GraphQL server fetching post titles. The GraphQL server, a pivotal player, retrieves data from jsonplaceholder.typicode.com, skillfully navigated through the Nginx reverse proxy. The GraphQL query that fuels this performance spectacle is as follows:

```graphql
{
  posts {
    title
  }
}
```

Today I learned why many pirated textbooks are in EPUB format. Initially, I thought EPUB was just a sophisticated way to read text, but there's more to it. EPUB, short for electronic publication, is essentially a packaged set of HTML files. This means any e-reader can open EPUB files much like how a web browser opens a website.

When pirated textbooks are distributed, the content often starts in HTML format because it's easier to extract and manipulate. Converting HTML to EPUB is straightforward, as both formats are web-based and support text, images, and hyperlinks. On the other hand, generating a PDF can be more complex because PDFs are designed to preserve the exact layout and formatting of the original document, which often requires more sophisticated tools and software.

Additionally, EPUB files are generally more flexible than PDFs. They can adjust to different screen sizes and allow users to customize their reading experience by changing font sizes, styles, and background colors. This adaptability makes EPUB a preferred format for e-readers and mobile devices.

So, the ease of conversion from HTML to EPUB, combined with the flexibility and functionality of EPUB files, makes them a popular choice for pirated textbooks.

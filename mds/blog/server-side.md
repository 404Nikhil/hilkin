# Not requiring server-side rendering:
In web development, server-side rendering (SSR) is the process of generating the HTML content of a web page on the server and sending it to the client’s browser. This allows search engines to index the page and provides initial content to users even before JavaScript loads.
If you don’t require server-side rendering, it means that your application or website can rely on client-side rendering (CSR). Client-side rendering implies that the web page is initially loaded with a minimal HTML structure. The JavaScript takes over to fetch data and dynamically render the content on the client’s browser.
Client-side rendering is suitable for applications where search engine optimization (SEO) is less critical, and you prioritize interactivity and dynamic updates on the client side. It requires JavaScript to be enabled on the client’s browser.
# Building server applications:
Building server applications refers to creating the backend logic and infrastructure that handle requests from clients and provide the necessary data or functionality. A server application typically receives requests, processes them, interacts with databases or external APIs, and returns responses to clients.
Server applications can be built using frameworks like Express.js, which simplifies handling HTTP requests, defining routes, and managing server-side logic.
Server applications are commonly used to build APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow clients (such as web or mobile applications) to communicate and exchange data with the server.
Server applications are also responsible for user authentication, data validation, and implementation of business logic. They handle operations that require secure and controlled access to server-side resources.
As a beginner, it’s important to understand the basics of both client-side rendering and server-side rendering. Initially, you can focus on building static web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which rely on client-side rendering. As you progress and learn more, you can explore frameworks like Next.js or React, which provide options for server-side rendering.

When it comes to building server applications, involves learning backend programming concepts, working with databases, and understanding HTTP request/response handling. Frameworks like Express.js can help simplify this process.

Remember, as a beginner, it’s great to start with static web pages and gradually expand your knowledge to more complex applications involving server-side rendering and server applications. Practice, experimentation, and gradually building more advanced projects will help solidify your understanding.

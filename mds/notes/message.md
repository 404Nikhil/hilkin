![Her POV](https://i.ibb.co/HL5DMqRd/image.png)

Happier I couldn't be,  
when I learned of this world divine,  
all for me to perceive,  
all for me to satisfy my mind.  

As the flower blooms in my heart,  
is the fate of this reality about to fall apart?  

Well, I've prepared for this occasion,  
two lanterns I brought  
one for me, one for her.  
We ran into the field beyond loss and despair,  
where the winds swept the pollen,  
and the world turned bare.  

See the children,  
their love  
it's vast.  
Their dreams  
we can feel them,  
not in the past.  
Beyond our withered souls,  
hopelessly admiring their illuminating hopes.  

I remember back when I had a pulse,  
I could bathe in sunlight,  
with heart aching,  
I still wonder  
if I could break the chains of time.  

**Forever burn,  
Forever breathe.**

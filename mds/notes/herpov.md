I lingered in the doorway and watched him stare at his lappy. The room was gloomy, like on a rainy day casting chills that seeped into my bones. The cursor was blinking over a username field: **@*********, our old shared account. The one we'd made to share midnight confessions, bad poetry, and of course the usual trolling. Now it's stuck behind a **"Forgot Password"**. Years of conversations, locked digitally. His eyes were a login screen I no longer had the password to.

He hadn't moved in hours, whenever I checked. Probably busy brute-forcing his way to attack his own memories.  
My finger itched to reach for him. To whisper the password we had set on a whim **@*********, but I'd forgotten it too.

Without looking at me, he heaved a heavy breath. I was very much familiar with that heave.  
A memory of him gazing at the moon popped in my head, and I felt a stingy pain as it was once a shared inbox on melancholic nights.
